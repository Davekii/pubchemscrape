Sulfur mustard is also an alkylating agent that damages the cells within the bone marrow that are necessary for making blood cells; this affects the body’s immune system. Finally, sulfur mustard also affects a part of the nervous system responsible for everyday bodily function, causing “cholinergic toxicity,” marked by excessive saliva, tears and urine; gastrointestinal (GI) cramping and diarrhea; vomiting (emesis); and constricted or pinpoint pupils (miosis). Sulfur mustard has been used as a chemical warfare agent to cause delayed casualties. It has an odor of garlic, onion, horseradish, or mustard.
